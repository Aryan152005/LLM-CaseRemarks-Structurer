Hello, Namaskar, I am Kamal Uniyal and I live in Suman Vihar, next to the Sansthan International School in Badripur. Where is the Chowki? Our house is in Badripur. I live in Suman Vihar, in the lane next to the Sansthan International School. What is the complaint? The complaint is that some road work is going on outside our house, which is fine, and the road that they are building, they are putting their civil line in urban development, so my concern was that I told them three days ago that my mother is having a surgery today at 2 pm, so please fix this road. They have dug potholes everywhere on the road and have not left any space for the vehicle to pass. I had to take my mother to the hospital. I brought her out from there in my big vehicle with great difficulty. My grievance is that there is no way for me to go back there at all. I need police help there because what have they done there? The people who are in the pocket, they searched there and ran away whereas I had specifically told them that you should be there at 2 o'clock, I have to go there at 2 o'clock, they told me and assured me that we will plan the road for you, your vehicle will go through, there is no problem, what police station will be there in Suman Vihar, Suman Vihar, Badripur, the nearest one is Jogi Wale, ours is Jogi Wala Chowki and Nehnu Colony Police Station, right now I have brought my mother to the hospital, her eye surgery is going on, now my concern is that I will bring the patient back, so these people have intentionally dug up that whole road, right now my name is Taman Honiyal, ma'am, I want to complain that they will fix it because this man in the pocket and the one with the tractor will assure me in the morning, they dug up the whole road, made pits and went away from there and ran away, please inform me, please help me, ma'am my mother is in front of me, it is six years, the work of civil line is going on, the work which is going on everywhere, the same work is going on, yes, of Civil Line, ma'am, they did something in front of us.
